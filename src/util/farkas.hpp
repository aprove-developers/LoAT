/**
 * Implementation of Farkas' lemma.
 *
 * The lemma is used to transform universal quantification to an equivalent formula
 * that only uses existential quantification. When we search for a metering function,
 * we have to existentially quantify over the function's coefficients (since we want to finde them).
 * Hence applying Farkas' lemma helps us to avoid mixing quantifiers (which makes the z3 query much faster).
 *
 * The relevant version of Farkas lemma:
 *   Forall x: (A*x <= b implies c*x <= delta) can be rewritten as:
 *   Exists l: l >= 0, l^T * A = c^T, l^T * b <= delta (we refer to l as lambda in the code)
 *
 * In our context, x are variables, A and b represent guard/update, c the metering function's coefficients.

    /**
     * Applies farkas lemma to transform the given constraints into z3 constraints.
     *
     * We represent the inequations "A*x <= b" by a list of Expressions,
     * which must be of the form "linear <= constant".
     *
     * The lists vars and coeffs must be of the same size and represent the variables
     * that (might) appear in the metering function and their corresponding coefficient symbols.
     * The absolute coefficient c0 is passed separately (since it does not belong to any variable).
     *
     * @note: The constraints may contain more variables (which are not contained in var).
     * To comply with the requirements of Farkas lemma, the coefficients for these extra
     * variables are simply set to zero (we need coefficients for every variable, as we have to compute c*x).
     *
     * @param constraints List of constraints of the form "linear term <= constant" (representing "A * x <= b")
     * @param vars List of variables ("x" or a subset of "x", where "x" are all variables in `constraints`)
     * @param coeffs List of z3 symbols for the coefficients (must be the same size as vars)
     * @param c0 The z3 symbol for the absolute coefficient
     * @param delta Integer value that is used as "delta" in Farkas lemma
     * @param context the Z3 context to create variables
     *
     * @return the resulting z3 expression (without quantifiers, as all variables are existentially quantified)
