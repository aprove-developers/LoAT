## LoAT -- the Loop Acceleration Tool

LoAT (**Lo**op **A**cceleration **T**ool, formerly known as **Lo**wer Bounds **A**nalysis **T**ool) is a fully automated tool to analyze programs operating on integers.
Currently, it supports the inference of **lower bounds** on the worst-case runtime complexity and **non-termination proving**.

For more information, please visit [LoAT's website](https://loat-developers.github.io/LoAT/).
